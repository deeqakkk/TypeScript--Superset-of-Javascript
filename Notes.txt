 ts compiler convert the code from ts to js


 Typescript benefit
  1. chech error on compile time
  2. add type like string,number,boolean,array,object,null,undefined
  3. we can add object oriented way with ts
  4. code is managed well
  5. Type-inference

  npm i --save-dev lite-server
  --save-dev means that package will be installed only for the development environment not for the production environment

  The key difference is: js uses "dynamic types"(resolved at runtime) while ts uses "static types"(resolved at development time).


  Core types Datatypes in ts:
  1. number : All numbers, no difference between int and float.
  2. boolean
  3. string
  4. Object: in ts we don't have key:value pair but instead we have key:type pair
  5. Array: in ts we have array of type
  6. Tuples: fixed length and type array
  7. enum: enum{new, old}
  8. any: any type is used to represent the dynamic type
  9. Union: union type is used to represent the multiple type of the same variable in ts
